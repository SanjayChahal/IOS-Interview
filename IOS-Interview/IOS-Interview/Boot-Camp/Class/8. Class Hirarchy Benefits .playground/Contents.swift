/* 1. Code Reusability:
      //Class hierarchy allows you to reuse common code by defining a base class with shared functionality that can be inherited by subclasses.
   2. Polymorphism and Flexibility:
      //Class hierarchy enables you to treat different objects as instances of a common superclass, providing flexibility and extensibility in handling diverse data types.
   3. Abstraction and Encapsulation:
      //Class hierarchy allows you to create abstract base classes with common interfaces, hiding internal details and promoting modular, maintainable code. --- In Swift we use Protocols for that
   4. Modularity and Separation of Concerns:
      //Class hierarchy breaks down complex systems into smaller, manageable components, improving code organization and readability.
